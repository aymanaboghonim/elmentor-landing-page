# Design Document: Elmentor Landing Page

## 1. Visual Identity & Branding

### 1.1. Logo Usage
- **Primary Logo:** Elmentor Program Logo (`src/assets/images/elmentor-logo.png`)
    - Placement: Top-left in the header on all pages for maximum brand visibility.
    - Clear Space: Maintain a minimum clear space equal to the height of the "E" in the logo on all sides. Do not crowd with navigation or other elements.
    - Minimum Size: Ensure the logo remains legible at all breakpoints (suggested minimum width: 48px on mobile).
- **Supporting Logo:** DevOps Visions Logo (`src/assets/images/DevOps-Visions.png`)
    - Placement: Typically in the footer, and optionally in an "About Us" or "Our Ecosystem" section to acknowledge the broader community.
    - Clear Space: Maintain similar clear space as the primary logo.

### 1.2. Color Palette
- **Primary Colors:**
    - **Deep Blue:** #1A237E (for header/footer backgrounds, primary buttons, and key highlights)
    - **Cool Gray:** #F5F7FA (for main backgrounds, cards, and section separation)
    - **Slate Gray:** #374151 (for body text and secondary elements)
- **Accent Color:**
    - **Vibrant Orange:** #FF9800 (for CTAs, highlights, and interactive elements)
- **Usage:**
    - Deep Blue: Brand identity, navigation, and strong visual anchors.
    - Cool Gray: Clean, modern backgrounds and card surfaces.
    - Slate Gray: Readable, modern text.
    - Vibrant Orange: Draw attention to buttons, links, and important highlights.

### 1.3. Typography
- **Primary Font Family:**
    - **English:** 'Open Sans', 'Roboto', Arial, sans-serif (modern, clean, highly readable)
    - **Arabic:** 'Cairo', 'Noto Sans Arabic', Tahoma, sans-serif (well-supported, modern, and pairs well with English fonts)
- **Typographic Hierarchy:**
    - **H1 (Main Titles):** 2.25rem (36px), 700 weight, 1.2 line height
    - **H2 (Sub-section Titles):** 1.5rem (24px), 600 weight, 1.3 line height
    - **H3 (Smaller Headings):** 1.125rem (18px), 600 weight, 1.4 line height
    - **Body Text:** 1rem (16px), 400 weight, 1.6 line height
    - **Links:** Underlined or bold, accent color (#FF9800), with clear hover/focus state (e.g., underline or color shift)
- **Readability Considerations:**
    - Use generous line heights for body text (1.6) and headings (1.2–1.4) for clarity.
    - Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background (meets WCAG AA standards).
    - Use font smoothing and antialiasing for crisp rendering on all devices.

## 2. Overall Page Layout & Structure

### 2.1. Wireframes / Lo-fi Mockups
- The Elmentor Landing Page will be a single-page application (SPA) with a vertical scrolling structure.
- Each major section (Hero, About, Circles, Activities, Founder, News & Updates, Benefits, Video, Contact, Community Presence, Footer) will be clearly delineated.
- Subtle background color variations (using the cool gray palette) or full-width visual separators will be used to distinguish sections.
- The layout will be clean and uncluttered, with ample white space to enhance readability and focus on content.
- All content will be center-aligned or use a consistent max-width container for large screens, with responsive adjustments for smaller devices.

### 2.2. Navigation Design
- **Header Navigation (Desktop):**
    - Navigation bar is present at the top of the page (sticky or reappearing on scroll up for usability).
    - Navigation links: Home, About, Activities, Circles, Founder, Blog, Contact Us. All links are clearly legible and spaced for easy access.
    - The active/current section link is visually distinguished (e.g., accent color underline, background highlight, or color change using #FF9800).
    - Clicking a navigation link smoothly scrolls to the corresponding section.
- **Header Navigation (Mobile/Tablet):**
    - A "hamburger" menu icon is used for smaller screens.
    - The menu expands as a full-screen overlay or a slide-out panel from the side, with navigation links stacked vertically and easily tappable.
    - The language switcher remains accessible within the mobile menu.
- **Language Switcher:**
    - Present in the header at all breakpoints.
    - Simple design: two toggle buttons ("EN"/"ع") or a dropdown. Clearly indicates the current language.
- **Footer Navigation:**
    - Key links (Contact Us, Code of Conduct, Privacy) are repeated in the footer for easy access, styled to match the overall design but with a more compact layout.

## 3. Section-Specific Design Considerations
*   #### 3.1. Hero Section Design Notes
*   **Overall Goal:** To create an impactful first impression, clearly communicate Elmentor's core message, and guide users towards engagement.
*   **Layout:**
    *   Full-width section, typically occupying a significant portion of the viewport height (e.g., 70-90vh) to command attention.
    *   Content (Headline, Sub-headline, CTA button) will be center-aligned horizontally and vertically (or slightly biased towards the top-middle for better readability above the fold).
    *   Ample padding around the content to avoid a cramped feel.
*   **Background:**
    *   **Option A (Clean & Professional):** A solid background using the "Cool Gray: #F5F7FA" from our palette, or a very subtle gradient incorporating the "Deep Blue: #1A237E" in a modern way (e.g., a light blue/grayish top fading to a slightly darker shade, or a radial gradient).
    *   **Option B (Subtle Texture/Pattern - if desired later):** Consideration for a very subtle, abstract, professional background pattern or texture that doesn't distract from the text. (For MVP, solid or subtle gradient is preferred).
    *   **No distracting full-bleed background image for the Hero section itself** to maintain focus on the messaging, unless a very high-quality, thematic, and non-obtrusive image is found later.
*   **Content Styling:**
    *   **Main Headline:** ("Join Elmentor: A Global Community... Empower through mentorship.")
        *   Use H1 typography settings from `Design.md` (e.g., 2.25rem, 700 weight).
        *   Color: "Slate Gray: #374151" or a darker shade of the "Deep Blue" if on a very light background, or White if on a dark background. Ensure high contrast.
    *   **Sub-headline/Introductory Text:** ("Connect, collaborate, and elevate your skills... 'If you want to go fast...'")
        *   Use a slightly smaller font size than H1 but larger than body text (e.g., H3 or custom size like 1.25rem), with a lighter weight (e.g., 400 or 500).
        *   Color: "Slate Gray: #374151" or a slightly lighter shade than the headline.
    *   **Primary Call to Action (CTA) Button:** ("Explore Our Community")
        *   Use the "Vibrant Orange: #FF9800" as the background color for high visibility.
        *   Text color: White or a very dark gray for contrast.
        *   Padding: Generous padding to make the button easily clickable/tappable.
        *   Shape: Slightly rounded corners for a modern feel.
        *   Hover Effect: Subtle change (e.g., slightly darker orange background or a slight shadow).
*   **Responsiveness:**
    *   Font sizes for headlines and text should scale down appropriately on smaller screens to maintain readability.
    *   The CTA button should remain prominent and easily tappable.
    *   The overall vertical height might adjust on very small screens to prevent excessive scrolling just for the hero.
*   #### 3.2. About Elmentor Program Section Design Notes
*   **Overall Goal:** To clearly and concisely communicate the core purpose, values, and operational model of the Elmentor Program, building understanding and interest.
*   **Layout & Structure:**
    *   The section should have a clear heading (e.g., "About the Elmentor Program" or "What is Elmentor?").
    *   Content could be structured in 2 or 3 distinct sub-parts for readability:
        1.  **Mission & Core Values:** A paragraph or a few bullet points outlining the program's mission and guiding principles.
        2.  **Program Offerings/Focus:** Briefly summarizing what members gain (e.g., mentorship, knowledge, networking, community).
        3.  **Operational Model (GitHub & Teams):** A concise explanation of how the community uses GitHub for structured knowledge and Teams for communication, highlighting transparency and collaboration.
    *   Consider a single-column layout for simplicity on most screens, ensuring focused reading. Alternatively, a two-column layout could be explored if there's a compelling visual element (e.g., a relevant icon or abstract graphic) to pair with the text, but text clarity is paramount.
*   **Background & Separation:**
    *   This section should have a background that distinguishes it from the Hero section and the subsequent section.
    *   Consider using the "Cool Gray: #F5F7FA" as a background, or a very light tint of the "Deep Blue: #1A237E" if the text contrast can be maintained effectively (e.g., with white text).
    *   A subtle top/bottom border or a slight change in background shade can act as a visual separator.
*   **Content Styling:**
    *   **Headings:** Use H2 or H3 typography from `Design.md` for the main section title and any sub-headings.
    *   **Body Text:** Use the standard body text typography. Ensure comfortable line length and spacing for readability.
    *   **Key Terms/Platforms (GitHub, Teams):** Consider subtly highlighting these terms (e.g., slightly bolder, or with small, recognizable icons if appropriate and not distracting).
*   **Visual Elements (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   To break up text and add visual interest, consider incorporating:
        *   Simple, relevant icons for Core Values or Program Offerings.
        *   Small, official logos for GitHub and Microsoft Teams when mentioning these platforms.
*   **Responsiveness:**
    *   Text should reflow gracefully on smaller screens.
    *   If a multi-column layout is used on desktop, it should stack to a single column on mobile.
    *   Ensure all elements remain legible and well-spaced.
