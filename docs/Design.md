# Design Document: Elmentor Landing Page

## 1. Visual Identity & Branding

### 1.1. Logo Usage
- **Primary Logo:** Elmentor Program Logo (`src/assets/images/elmentor-logo.png`)
    - Placement: Top-left in the header on all pages for maximum brand visibility.
    - Clear Space: Maintain a minimum clear space equal to the height of the "E" in the logo on all sides. Do not crowd with navigation or other elements.
    - Minimum Size: Ensure the logo remains legible at all breakpoints (suggested minimum width: 48px on mobile).
- **Supporting Logo:** DevOps Visions Logo (`src/assets/images/DevOps-Visions.png`)
    - Placement: Typically in the footer, and optionally in an "About Us" or "Our Ecosystem" section to acknowledge the broader community.
    - Clear Space: Maintain similar clear space as the primary logo.

### 1.2. Color Palette
- **Primary Colors:**
    - **Deep Blue:** #1A237E (for header/footer backgrounds, primary buttons, and key highlights)
    - **Cool Gray:** #F5F7FA (for main backgrounds, cards, and section separation)
    - **Slate Gray:** #374151 (for body text and secondary elements)
- **Accent Color:**
    - **Vibrant Orange:** #FF9800 (for CTAs, highlights, and interactive elements)
- **Usage:**
    - Deep Blue: Brand identity, navigation, and strong visual anchors.
    - Cool Gray: Clean, modern backgrounds and card surfaces.
    - Slate Gray: Readable, modern text.
    - Vibrant Orange: Draw attention to buttons, links, and important highlights.

### 1.3. Typography
- **Primary Font Family:**
    - **English:** 'Open Sans', 'Roboto', Arial, sans-serif (modern, clean, highly readable)
    - **Arabic:** 'Cairo', 'Noto Sans Arabic', Tahoma, sans-serif (well-supported, modern, and pairs well with English fonts)
- **Typographic Hierarchy:**
    - **H1 (Main Titles):** 2.25rem (36px), 700 weight, 1.2 line height
    - **H2 (Sub-section Titles):** 1.5rem (24px), 600 weight, 1.3 line height
    - **H3 (Smaller Headings):** 1.125rem (18px), 600 weight, 1.4 line height
    - **Body Text:** 1rem (16px), 400 weight, 1.6 line height
    - **Links:** Underlined or bold, accent color (#FF9800), with clear hover/focus state (e.g., underline or color shift)
- **Readability Considerations:**
    - Use generous line heights for body text (1.6) and headings (1.2â€“1.4) for clarity.
    - Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background (meets WCAG AA standards).
    - Use font smoothing and antialiasing for crisp rendering on all devices.
