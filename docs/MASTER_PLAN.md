# Master Plan: "Elmentor" Community Landing Page (Comprehensive, Detailed, & Agent-Centric - Local Workflow Focus)

## 1. Project Name
Elmentor Community Landing Page

## 2. Project Goal/Objective
*   To create a professional, informative, engaging, and high-quality landing page for the "Elmentor" community, primarily for showcasing during a global Microsoft event (e.g., AI Skills Fest / Season of Agents), reflecting the community's standards.
*   The landing page may potentially be used as a persistent public-facing introduction to the community post-event, serving as a central hub.
*   To meticulously document the development process, making it highly reproducible as a live demo or recorded session, effectively showcasing the capabilities, workflow, and best practices of using GitHub Copilot Agent Mode for building modern web applications. This includes demonstrating the Agent's ability to plan, execute, and verify its work, starting from a local setup.

## 3. Brief Project Description
This project entails the development of a static, frontend-only, single-page application (SPA) to serve as the official landing page for the "Elmentor" community. The page will be built using modern web technologies including HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, with the React.js library for a robust, component-based, and scalable architecture. Development will primarily occur in a local VS Code environment, with significant utilization of GitHub Copilot Agent Mode for code generation, task automation, UI component creation, self-planning, basic self-testing, and overall development assistance, including managing Git commits and pushes to a remote GitHub repository. GitHub Codespaces may serve as an alternative or collaborative environment. The final, polished landing page will be deployed and hosted on GitHub Pages. The page will be designed to be bilingual, supporting both English (primary) and Arabic, with a strong focus on user experience (UX) and visual appeal.
