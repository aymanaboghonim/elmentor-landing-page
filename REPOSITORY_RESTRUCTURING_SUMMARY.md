# Repository Restructuring Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to restructure the Elmentor Landing Page repository.

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. **Created New Directory Structure**
- Created `config/` directory for configuration files
- Utilized existing `docs/` directory for documentation
- Utilized existing `scripts/` directory for all scripts

### 2. **Moved Files to New Locations**
- **Configuration Files**:
  - Moved `eslint.config.js` to `config/eslint.config.js`
  - Created `config/build-config.ps1` for build configuration
  
- **Script Files**:
  - Moved `deploy.ps1` and `deploy.sh` to `scripts/` directory
  - Moved `copy-arabic.ps1` and `copy-arabic.sh` to `scripts/` directory
  - Moved `playwright-screenshot.js` to `scripts/` directory
  - Moved `ux-analysis.js` to `scripts/` directory
  - Moved `enhanced-elmentor-automation.ps1` and `enhanced-elmentor-automation-v2.ps1` to `scripts/` directory
  - Moved `footer-check.js` to `scripts/` directory

- **Documentation Files**:
  - Moved all documentation MD files to the `docs/` directory
  - Moved all readiness checklists, plans, and reports to `docs/` directory

### 3. **Updated References**
- Modified `package.json` to reference scripts in their new locations
- Created placeholder README.md files in each new directory
- Created `REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md` to document the new structure

### 4. **Tested Functionality**
- Successfully ran `npm run build` with the new structure
- Successfully ran `npm run deploy -- --dry-run` to verify GitHub Pages deployment

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Measures Taken

1. Created branch `repo-restructure` for safe implementation
2. Maintained the backup at `d:\Backups\elmentor_landing_page_backup_manual_*`
3. Kept critical files (vite.config.js, package.json) in the root to maintain GitHub Pages functionality
4. Tested build and deployment process after changes

## üìã Benefits of New Structure

- **Better Organization**: Files are now grouped by purpose and function
- **Reduced Root Directory Clutter**: Root directory is now clean and focused
- **Improved Maintainability**: Easier to find and update related files
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Clear directory structure with READMEs
- **Preserved Functionality**: All existing scripts and deployment processes still work

## üîÑ Next Steps

1. Commit changes to the `repo-restructure` branch
2. Create a pull request to merge into main
3. After testing and review, deploy with the new structure
4. Update documentation to reflect the new repository organization

## üìÑ Files Unchanged in Root (Intentional)

The following files were intentionally kept in the root directory to maintain GitHub Pages functionality:

- `vite.config.js` - Critical for build configuration
- `package.json` - Central for npm scripts and dependencies
- `index.html` - Entry point for the application
- `arabic.html` - Main Arabic version entry point
