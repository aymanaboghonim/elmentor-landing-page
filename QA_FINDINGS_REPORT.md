# El Mentor Landing Page - QA Findings Report

## Date: May 30, 2025

## Overview

This report summarizes the findings from our automated QA testing of the El Mentor landing page. The tests included visual screenshots across different devices and an automated UX analysis to detect potential issues.

## Screenshot Analysis

We captured screenshots of both the English and Arabic versions at the following sizes:
- Desktop (1280×800)
- Tablet (768×1024)
- Mobile (375×667)

### Key Visual Findings:

1. **Circles Section Image**: The image path in the Circles Section needs adjustment. The image is not loading correctly because the path `/src/assets/images/elmentor-circles .png` is invalid in the production build. This is a critical issue that must be fixed before deployment.

2. **Header Transparency**: The semi-transparent header with blur effect is working as expected and provides better eye comfort during scrolling.

3. **Footer Color**: The darker footer color is properly implemented and reduces eye strain.

4. **Arabic Version Placeholder**: The Arabic version placeholder displays properly with RTL text direction.

5. **Mobile Responsiveness**: The site appears generally responsive, but there are some alignment issues in the mobile view that could be improved.

## UX Analysis

Our automated UX analysis detected several issues that should be addressed:

### 1. Contrast Issues

Several text elements have insufficient contrast with their background, particularly:
- Light gray text on white backgrounds in the footer links
- Some blue text on light blue backgrounds in the hero section

### 2. Small Touch Targets

Several interactive elements are smaller than the recommended 44×44px minimum size:
- Social media icons in the footer
- Some navigation links in mobile view

### 3. Missing Alt Text

A few images lack proper alt text:
- Social media icons
- Some decorative elements

## Path Issues

The primary issue that needs immediate attention is the image path in the Circles Section. The current path:

```jsx
src="/src/assets/images/elmentor-circles .png"
```

This path works in development but will fail in production for two reasons:
1. The leading `/src/` is a development path not available in production
2. There's an extra space in the filename `elmentor-circles .png`

## Recommendations

1. **Fix the Circles image path**:
   - Copy the image to the `public` directory
   - Update the path to be relative to the public directory
   - Remove the space in the filename

2. **Improve contrast**:
   - Darken text colors or lighten backgrounds where contrast is insufficient
   - Use the CSS custom properties consistently

3. **Increase touch target sizes**:
   - Ensure all interactive elements are at least 44×44px on mobile

4. **Fix HTML best practices**:
   - Add missing alt text to all images
   - Fix any HTML validation errors

## Next Steps

1. Address the critical image path issue
2. Fix the highest priority UX issues
3. Run another round of QA tests
4. Deploy to a staging environment for final verification
