# Repository Restructuring Pull Request

## Overview
This PR implements a comprehensive restructuring of the repository to improve organization, maintainability, and code clarity while preserving all functionality, particularly GitHub Pages deployment.

## Changes Made
- Created organized directory structure: `config/`, `docs/`, and `scripts/`
- Moved configuration files to `config/` directory
- Moved documentation files to `docs/` directory
- Moved scripts to `scripts/` directory
- Updated package.json scripts to reference new file locations
- Added new deployment testing utilities
- Enhanced vite.config.js with optimized server configuration
- Added detailed documentation about the new structure

## Testing Performed
- ✅ Successfully built project with new structure
- ✅ Successfully performed deployment dry run
- ✅ Verified GitHub Pages compatibility
- ✅ All scripts work with updated paths

## Impact on Deployment
The changes maintain full compatibility with GitHub Pages deployment because:
1. The critical `vite.config.js` file remains in the root with the correct base path
2. All script references in package.json were updated to point to new locations
3. The deployment process was verified with a dry run

## Additional Benefits
- Reduced root directory clutter (60+ files down to essential core)
- Improved code organization and discoverability
- Better documentation with directory-specific README files
- Added deployment testing tools for easier troubleshooting

## Reviewers
Please verify:
- [ ] Scripts work with their new paths
- [ ] GitHub Pages deployment succeeds
- [ ] No regression in site functionality

## Screenshots
Before: 60+ files in root directory
After: Organized directory structure with logical grouping
